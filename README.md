#How to Encrypt Decrypt File in Java ?

Using Cipher class and RSA algorithm we can encrypt and decrypt a file.

#What is Chiper Class?
This is a java class, use cryptographic algorithm for encryption and decryption.

#RSA Algorithm

RSA, is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used for message encryption and decryption. 
Asymmetric means that there are two different keys used for encryption and decryption.
For encryption we use public key and for decryption we use private key.
public key is given to everyone but the other key(private) must be kept secrete.
